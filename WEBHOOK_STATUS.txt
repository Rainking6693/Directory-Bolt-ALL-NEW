✅ WEBHOOK SECRET STATUS

Your webhook secret IS configured and valid!

📋 Important Notes:

1. Local .env file: ✅ Secret is set
2. Netlify Environment Variables: ⚠️  Make sure it's also set there
3. Stripe Dashboard: ⚠️  Verify webhook endpoint URL matches your Netlify URL
4. Test vs Live: ⚠️  Detected LIVE mode - make sure webhook secret matches LIVE webhook

🔧 To ensure it works:

1. Add STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET to Netlify:
   Site settings > Environment variables > Add variable

2. Verify in Stripe Dashboard:
   https://dashboard.stripe.com/webhooks
   - Check endpoint URL matches: https://your-app.netlify.app/api/webhooks/stripe-secure
   - Copy webhook secret and verify it matches Netlify env var

3. Test webhook:
   - Send test event from Stripe Dashboard
   - Should return 200 OK
