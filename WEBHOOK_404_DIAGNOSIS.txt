🔍 DIAGNOSIS: 404 Webhook Error

✅ File exists: pages/api/webhooks/stripe.js

🔧 To Fix:

1. Test endpoint directly:
   curl https://directorybolt.com/api/webhooks/stripe
   (Should return 405, not 404)

2. Check Netlify build logs:
   - Go to Netlify Dashboard > Deploys
   - Check if API routes are building

3. Verify file is committed:
   git ls-files pages/api/webhooks/stripe.js

4. Try alternative URL in Stripe:
   https://directorybolt.com/api/webhooks/stripe-secure
