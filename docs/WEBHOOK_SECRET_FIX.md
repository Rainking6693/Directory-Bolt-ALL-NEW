# üîß Webhook Secret Configuration Fix

## ‚úÖ Current Status

Your webhook secret **IS configured** and **IS valid**:
- ‚úÖ Format: Correct (`whsec_...`)
- ‚úÖ Length: Valid (38 characters)
- ‚úÖ Mode: LIVE MODE detected

## ‚ö†Ô∏è The Issue

The webhook secret works, but there are a few things to verify:

### 1. **Netlify Environment Variables**

The webhook secret needs to be set in **Netlify's environment variables**, not just your local `.env` file.

**To fix:**
1. Go to **Netlify Dashboard** > Your Site > **Site settings** > **Environment variables**
2. Check if `STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET` is set
3. If not, add it with your webhook secret value
4. Make sure it's set for **Production** environment

### 2. **Test vs Live Mode Mismatch**

Your script detected **LIVE MODE** keys, but you might be testing with **TEST MODE** webhooks.

**To fix:**
- **Test Mode:** Use webhook secret from `https://dashboard.stripe.com/test/webhooks`
- **Live Mode:** Use webhook secret from `https://dashboard.stripe.com/webhooks`
- Make sure the webhook secret matches the mode of your Stripe keys

### 3. **Webhook Endpoint URL**

The webhook endpoint in Stripe Dashboard must match your Netlify URL.

**To verify:**
1. Go to Stripe Dashboard > Webhooks
2. Check your webhook endpoint URL
3. It should be: `https://your-app.netlify.app/api/webhooks/stripe-secure`
4. If different, update it to match your Netlify deployment URL

## üß™ Testing the Webhook

### Test 1: Verify Webhook Secret Locally
```bash
node scripts/verify-webhook-secret.js
```

### Test 2: Test Webhook Endpoint
1. Go to Stripe Dashboard > Webhooks
2. Click on your webhook endpoint
3. Click **"Send test webhook"**
4. Select event: `checkout.session.completed`
5. Click **"Send test webhook"**
6. Should return `200 OK`

### Test 3: Check Webhook Logs
1. In Stripe Dashboard, go to your webhook endpoint
2. Click **"Recent events"** tab
3. Check for:
   - ‚úÖ Green checkmarks = Success
   - ‚ùå Red X = Failed (check error message)

## üîç Common Issues

### Issue: "Webhook secret not configured"
**Cause:** `STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET` not set in Netlify environment variables
**Fix:** Add it in Netlify Dashboard > Site settings > Environment variables

### Issue: "Invalid webhook signature"
**Cause:** Webhook secret doesn't match the one in Stripe Dashboard
**Fix:** 
1. Go to Stripe Dashboard > Webhooks > Your endpoint
2. Click "Reveal" on signing secret
3. Copy the exact secret
4. Update `STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET` in Netlify

### Issue: "Webhook not receiving events"
**Cause:** Webhook endpoint URL mismatch or webhook disabled
**Fix:**
1. Verify webhook URL in Stripe matches your Netlify URL
2. Make sure webhook is enabled (not disabled)
3. Check that correct events are selected

### Issue: "Test mode vs Live mode mismatch"
**Cause:** Using test webhook secret with live keys (or vice versa)
**Fix:**
- Use test webhook secret with `sk_test_` keys
- Use live webhook secret with `sk_live_` keys
- Don't mix them!

## ‚úÖ Verification Checklist

- [ ] `STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET` is set in Netlify environment variables
- [ ] Webhook secret matches the one in Stripe Dashboard
- [ ] Webhook endpoint URL in Stripe matches your Netlify URL
- [ ] Test mode secret used with test keys (or live secret with live keys)
- [ ] Webhook is enabled in Stripe Dashboard
- [ ] Correct events are selected (`checkout.session.completed`, etc.)
- [ ] Test webhook returns `200 OK`

## üöÄ Quick Fix Commands

### Verify webhook secret:
```bash
node scripts/verify-webhook-secret.js
```

### Test webhook endpoint (if server running locally):
```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/api/webhooks/stripe-secure \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"test": "data"}'
# Should return 400/401 (expected - no signature)
```

## üìù Summary

**Your webhook secret IS configured correctly!** 

The webhook should work if:
1. ‚úÖ Secret is in Netlify environment variables (not just local .env)
2. ‚úÖ Webhook endpoint is configured in Stripe Dashboard
3. ‚úÖ Webhook secret matches the one in Stripe Dashboard
4. ‚úÖ Test/live mode matches between keys and webhook secret

If you're still having issues, check:
- Netlify function logs
- Stripe Dashboard webhook logs
- Make sure you're testing with the correct mode (test vs live)
