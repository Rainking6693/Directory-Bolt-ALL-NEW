## ‚ö†Ô∏è Important: Your Webhook Endpoint

Your current endpoint in Stripe is:
```
https://directorybolt.com/api/webhooks/stripe
```

You have TWO webhook handlers:
- ‚úÖ `/api/webhooks/stripe.js` - This is what you're currently using (matches your Stripe config)
- ‚úÖ `/api/webhooks/stripe-secure.ts` - This is the newer secure version

**Recommendation:** 
- If `/api/webhooks/stripe` is working, keep using it
- Or update Stripe to use `/api/webhooks/stripe-secure` for enhanced security

## üß™ Using Stripe CLI (Easiest Way)

If you can't find the button, use Stripe CLI:

```bash
# Install Stripe CLI first (if needed)
# Then login
stripe login

# Trigger a test checkout completion event
stripe trigger checkout.session.completed

# Or forward webhooks to your endpoint
stripe listen --forward-to https://directorybolt.com/api/webhooks/stripe
```
